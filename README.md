# Breast Cancer Prediction using Random Forest

This project uses the scikit-learn breast cancer dataset.

- The program asks you to enter 30 tumor features.
- It then predicts whether the tumor is **Benign (not cancer)** or **Malignant (cancer)**.
- Finally, it shows a bar chart comparing your input with the average benign & malignant values.
