# 🧬Breast Cancer Prediction using Random Forest

This project applies Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier) to predict whether a tumor is Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous) based on medical features.  
 
## 📌Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates. This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in **Medical Decision-Making** by predicting cancer likelihood using tumor characteristics.  

## ⚙️Working

•The model is trained on a breast cancer dataset containing 30 tumor features.  
•Users enter these 30 input features manually.  
•The program predicts the tumor type:  
   ✅ Benign → Tumor is not cancerous.  
   ⚠️ Malignant → Tumor is cancerous.  
•A bar chart is displayed to compare user inputs with the average values for benign and malignant tumors.  

## 🚀Technologies Used:  

•**Python**  
•**Random Forest Classifier (ML algorithm)**  
•**Matplotlib for Visualization**  

## 📈Prediction Summary & Visualization

•Once the input features are processed, the program displays the predicted tumor type:  
   ✅ **Benign → Non-cancerous**  
   ⚠️ **Malignant → Cancerous**  
•A bar chart compares your feature values with the average measurements for benign and malignant tumors, giving a clear visual context.  
•Users can quickly interpret the results without delving into the raw numbers.
